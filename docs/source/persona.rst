Sign up for a Persona account
=============================

Minion ships with Persona authentication. You can always
replace the authentication method with your own
if you do not find Persona authentication useful. If you
do not have a Persona account, follow the steps below:

1. Go to `Persona Login <https://login.persona.org/>`_

2. Click on **Sign in**

3. Enter an email address.

4. If this email address has not been registered as a
   Persona account, the login dialog will ask you
   to enter a password. For Gmail ad YMail users,
   you will be authenticated against the Gmail
   or YMail server.
