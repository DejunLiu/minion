Mozilla Minion
##############

Minion is a security testing framework built by Mozilla to bridge the gap between developers and security testers. To do so, it enables developers to scan with a wide variety of security tools, using a simple HTML-based interface.

It consists of three umbrella projects:

.. include:: include/minion_repos.rst

Minion has limited scanning functionality built into itself. Instead, it relies on the large variety of pre-existing open source and commercial scanning tools. These plugins include:

.. include:: include/plugin_repos.rst
