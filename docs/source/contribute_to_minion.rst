Minion is built using open source projects such as Python, AngularJS and Twsited, so
we want to keep it open source. Furthermore, we believe that
**"secrecy does not buy additional security."** (*Kerckhoff's principle*) Security testing
is not an exclusive privilege. Instead, security testing should be as agile as possible.

In order to make Minion feature richer and secure, we invite the community to contribute
in any way they can. If you have ideas to submit, or have issues to report, you encoruage
